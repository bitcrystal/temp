1. To start the wallet 
   use start_bitcrystal_wallet.bat 
   or bitcrystal-qt.exe which created 
   automatically after starting 
   the start_bitcrystal_wallet.bat
2. When you start the start_bitcrystal_wallet.bat for the first time,
   then it takes a little while to running the wallet because he downloaded automatically
   and installed the latest bootstrap.dat file for you.
